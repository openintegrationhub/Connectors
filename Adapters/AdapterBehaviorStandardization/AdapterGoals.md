# Adapter Goals
**Version Publish Date: 01.03.2018**

**Semantic Version of Document: 1.0.0**

This document identifies goals *that can be generalized across systems* and then
lists the standard implementations that satisfy those
goals.

This document is formatted in the following way:
1. Different goals of an adapter are listed.
2. For each goal, different implementations of that goal are listed.

## Bulk Extract
**Goal:** An entire data set exists in the system.  An integrator wants to export all of
the data or all of that data which matches certain criteria that exists in the
system through an integration flow.

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
* Bulk Extract
* Get Objects Polling

## Detect Data/Object Changes
**Goal:** As object data is added to, updated in and deleted from the system, we want a
flow to be triggered with that information.

We may also want to observe changes in many-to-many relationships

We may also want to be able to trigger flows when objects undergo a merge
operation (e.g. merge duplicate contacts).

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
Basic Case:
* Get Objects Polling
* Get Objects Webhook
* Bulk Extract (with integration platform side delta detection)
Delete Case:
* Get Deleted Objects Polling
* Get Deleted Objects Webhook
* Bulk Extract (with integration platform side deletion detection)
Merge Case:
TBD
Link Case:
TBD

## System Specific Event Observation
**Goal:** Be able to trigger flows when events or modifications happen within
the system which are distinct from *CRUD* operations.

*Examples: an email tracking program detects that
an email has been opened, some async operation has been completed*

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
* Get Events Polling
* Get Events Webhook
* Bulk Extract (of event log with integration platform side delta detection)

## Lookup Information in the System
**Goal:** The system supports some mechanisms to query data.  You want to execute some
 query in order to fetch the corresponding data.  This includes the case when
 you have some information which is expected to at most one record in the system
 and you want the rest of the information associated with that record.  Some
 systems support system specific query language that may be exposed. (e.g. SQL
 in a SQL database, [Salesforce's
 SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm),
 etc.)

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
* Lookup Object By Field(s)
* Lookup Objects By Criteria
* Execute System Specific Query/Modification Language Operation

## Modify Records in the System
**Goal:** The system duplicates some part of some set of information that is
stored in another system.  As information in the other system changes, you want
those changes to be propagated into this system.

The system may also have objects which have relationships to other objects
*within the same system.  We want to modify those relationships.

The system has objects which can be merged with other objects of the
same type within the system. We want to trigger such merges.

*Examples: Duplicate contact merge, corporate merge*

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
Create, Update and Delete Information in the System:
* upsertObject
* deepCreateObject
* deleteObject
Set Data for Object:
* setDataForObject
Manipulate Links Between Objects:
* upsertLink
* deleteLink
Merge Objects:
TBD

## Perform a System Action/Invoke a System Function
**Goal:** The system supports the ability to
* trigger events (which may or may not result in side-effects outside the system)
* to modify the state of data inside the system in a way that is distinct from *CRUD* operations
* provide the results a complex calculation based on some inputs
* execute statements in a system specific data modification language that is
exposed. (e.g. SQL in a SQL database, [Salesforce's
SOQL](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm),
etc.)

*Examples: Send an email, flag document as helpful, [OData
Actions](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Actions_1),
Calculate the shipping price of a package, [OData
Functions](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Functions_1), SQL stored procedures*

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
* Perform Action/Evaluate Function
* Execute System Specific Query/Modification Language Operation

## Expose Endpoint(s)
**Goal:** The system has a API which exposes some endpoints.  An integrator
wants to interact with those endpoints directly and does not want the API
functionality abstracted away from them.  The only abstractions the integrator
may want are:
* Knowing/building the URL to which the request is provided
* Handling any authentication required by the request
* Exposing all inputs to the integration platform
* Carrying out the request, provide the results of the request back to the
platform and handling any errors that occur in the process

**Standardized Actions and Triggers:**
* Exposed Endpoint
* Generic Request

An integrator who is using a connector to build an integration will have a set
of goals for their integration.  Some common goals are listed and explained in
the document
[`AdapterGoals.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/AdapterGoals.md).
In order to satisfy these goals, the connector should expose functionality in a
standardized way *(if that goal can be generalized across systems)*.  The
document
[`StandardizedActionsAndTriggers.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/StandardizedActionsAndTriggers.md)
lists these standardizations. Furthermore it describes what functionality is
required in the CSP's API in order build such an action/trigger.

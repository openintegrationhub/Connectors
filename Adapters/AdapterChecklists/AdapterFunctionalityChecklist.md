# Adapter Functionality Checklist
**Version Publish Date: 26.02.2018**

**Semantic Version of Document: 1.0.0**

The goal of this document is to track connector completeness based on the
functionality provided by the API.

# Instructions
1. Copy this document from the OIH repository and place it in the repository for
the adapter.
2. Identify what can be built:
   * Of the following possible Actions and Triggers listed, strike through all
actions and triggers which can not be built for a system based on API
limitations of that system.
   * Enter system specific functionality that can be exposed by the adapter.
   * Identify static object types (if object types are static).
   * Identify endpoints which may be sensibly exposed by the adapter.
3. As actions and triggers are built, check of those items on this checklist.

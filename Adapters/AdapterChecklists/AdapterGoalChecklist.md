# Adapter Goal Checklist
**Version Publish Date: 01.03.2018**

**Semantic Version of Document: 1.0.0**

The goal of this document is to provide a menu of functionality that could exist
in a connector.  Can be provided to a non-CSP MSE (CSP consumer) requesting the
construction of a connector.

# Instructions
1. Provide a copy of this form to the customer.
2. Have the customer complete this form.
3. Prepare the the `AdapterFunctionalityChecklist.md` for the system.
4. Ensure that for all boxes checked yes on this form, that the system's API
supports the required functionality.  If not, inform the customer that their
order can not be completed.
5. Identify which actions and triggers need to be built to support all the cases
checked yes by the customer.

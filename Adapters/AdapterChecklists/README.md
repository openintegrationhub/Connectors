# Completeness Checklists for Adapters

The documents in this folder are designed to be checklists.  Here is a list of
current checklists:
* [`AdapterDescriptionAndDocumentationChecklist.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/AdapterDescriptionAndDocumentationChecklist.md):
 Describes what should be documented in the adapter `README.md`,`component.json` and similar files.
* [`AdapterGoalChecklist.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/AdapterGoalChecklist.md):
Provides a menu of functionality that could exist in a connector. Can be
provided to a non-CSP MSE (CSP consumer) requesting the construction of a
connector.
* [`DesiredAdapterBehaviors.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/DesiredAdapterBehaviors.md):
Lists what behaviors should be present in a complete adaptor.
* [`RequirementsToTestOrBuildAnAdapter.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/RequirementsToTestOrBuildAnAdapter.md):
List what is access to a system is required to build or test an adapter.
* [`AdapterFunctionalityChecklist.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/AdapterFunctionalityChecklist.md):
Provide a menu of functionality that could exist in a connector.  Can be used
to:
  * Be provided to formalize estimates for a non-CSP MSE (CSP consumer) requesting
the construction of a connector
  * Be used to track connector completeness based on the functionality provided by
the API
* [`QualityCheckResultsTemplate.md`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization/QualityCheckResultsTemplate.md):
Provides a template to document the results from adapter quality checks.

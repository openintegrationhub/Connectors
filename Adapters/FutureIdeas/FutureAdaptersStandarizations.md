# Future Adapters Standardizations

This document identifies items which could exist as part of *Adapter Behavior
Standardization* but aren't part of the current standard because of some
combination of the following reasons:
* require more buy-in from other parties
* are proposals that require more real world validation
* are based on speculative requirements from other Open Integration Hub groups

This document discusses possible ways in which these items may be
standardized in the future.

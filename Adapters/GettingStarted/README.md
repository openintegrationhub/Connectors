# Getting Started

If you're interested in developing an adapter we suggest to start with reading the [`AdapterGuide`](AdapterGuide.md).

- It helps to understand the basic concepts of an adapter and lists functionalities that your connector should come along with
- It also lists documentation requirements for your repository

To get more detailed information regarding the adapters and triggers that you've learned about in the adapter guide, please have a look at  [`AdapterBehaviorStandardization`](../AdapterBehaviorStandardization/StandardizedActionsAndTriggers.md)

- It describe the various actions and triggers in detail
- It also describes the required input- and output data, some gotcha's to look out for and a pseudo code for each trigger/actions

For actual implementations of Adapters, please checkout our examples:

- [`SnazzyContacts`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/snazzycontacts-adapter)
- [`Wice`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/wicecrm-adapter)
  
Once you have finished creating an Adapter there is a file called [`AdapterFunctionalityChecklist`](../AdapterChecklists/AdapterFunctionalityChecklist.md) which helps you to document all functionalities of your Adapter and therefore  make it more comprehensible for third parties.

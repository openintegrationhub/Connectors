# Adapter Documentation

If you are not familiar with adapters, the document [`AdapterGuide.md`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Connectors/blob/master/Adapters/AdapterGuide.md) is
designed to be a starting point.  It explains the problems which an adapter must
solve and the recommended way of solving those problems.

There is an additional folder
[`AdapterChecklists`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Connectors/tree/master/Adapters/AdapterChecklists)
which contains checklists which can be used to verify adapter completeness as
well as to identify the API provider requirements.

There is a document [`AdapterOperationTypes.md`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Connectors/blob/master/Adapters/AdapterOperationTypes.md) which lists the types of operations an adapter can perform as well as the related API functionality which must exist for an efficient implementation of these functionalities.

There is an additional document
[`OpenQuestions.md`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Connectors/blob/master/Adapters/OpenQuestions.md)
which discusses potential shortcomings and enhancements to the current adapter
approach.

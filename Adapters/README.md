# Adapter Documentation

* If you are not familiar with adapters, the document [`AdapterGuide.md`](/Adapters/AdapterGuide.md) is
designed to be a starting point.  It explains the problems which an adapter must
solve and the recommended way of solving those problems.

* There is an additional folder
[`AdapterChecklists`](/Adapters/AdapterChecklists/)
which contains checklists which can be used to verify adapter completeness as
well as to identify the API provider requirements.

* There is an additional folder
[`AdapterBehaviorStandardization`](/Adapters/AdapterBehaviorStandardization)
which describes the various forms of behavior that a component can perform and
the standard way of exposing that functionality.

* There is an additional document
[`OpenQuestionsForOtherOIHWorkgroups.md`](/Adapters/OpenQuestionsForOtherOIHWorkgroups.md).
This document outlines potential design decisions made by other workgroups which
would effect some of the design decisions related to connector standardization.

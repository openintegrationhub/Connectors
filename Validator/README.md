## How it works

The validator validates a given JSON object against a deposited JSON schema. The main purpose of this component is to validate the correctness of the output of the transformer. The typical scenario in which the validator is used is: `Adapter` --> `Transformer` --> `Validator`. This means, the data from the application is transferred via the adapter and is afterwars transferred to the transformer where the data is semantically mapped. To ensure the correctnes of the mapping the validator follows right after the transformer and either respons with a success or error message.
